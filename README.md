# Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) imitation

## Description & Features
We are proud to present you our implementation of the ARC caching algorithm.

## Latest version
The latest version of our ARC caching algorithm implementation can be found here: <https://github.com/protobarhatus/arc_cash>.

## How-to-use
### Configuration

### Building and compiling

## Documentation
As it was mentioned before, an accurate and comprehensive description of ARC and FRC algorithms plus various statistics and a bunch of other useful information can be found in Nimrod Megiddo's and Dharmendra S. Modha's "Outperforming LRU with an Adaptive Replacement Cache Algorithm" article [here](http://theory.stanford.edu/~megiddo/pdf/IEEE_COMPUTER_0404.pdf). More particular in-code documentation (compatible with Doxygen) can be added upon request.
